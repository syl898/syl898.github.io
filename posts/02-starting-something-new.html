              I’ve been sitting and staring at this blank screen all afternoon (it’s currently 9 pm) without having written a single word. It’s not a lack of ideas (there are literally endless possibilities for what to write about) and it’s not a lack of initiative (I’ve already set this whole thing up). Right now, it’s the immense pressure to be good at the things that you do. There’s a certain standard in my head of where I want my work to be at and if I can’t reach it then I think to myself maybe it’s not worth me doing after all. 
              <br><br>
              There’s only so much time in each day, and there are only so many things you can do with your time. Picking and choosing where you spend that time is incredibly important, but that’s led us to this system where people only do the things they’re good at or only the things that reward them monetarily. The people that are visible doing these things are the people who have mastered their craft (or have mastered it enough to be well-recognized). Comparing yourself to them is both motivating and incredibly discouraging at the same time.
              <br><br>
              Successful writers, artists, entrepreneurs, designers, you name it, are there to show you what is achievable in the realm of that domain and offer some insight on how to get there. They’ll tell you that it takes time and hard work, and there are no shortcuts around that. It’s comforting to know, but doesn’t help you in the short run.
              <br><br>
              In the short run, surrounding yourself with content from all these successful people is a brutal reminder that you’re not there yet. Especially starting out, you’re far from it. When you’re not good at something, not earning any money from it, and don’t have any traditional reasons for pursuing it, the question then becomes - why are you <br>doing it? 
              <br><br>
              Coming up with that justification, that validation, is hard when so many other things are competing for your attention. And when you do decide to give it your time, <br>you’re faced with another challenge: how do I get from where I am now to<br> where I want to be?
              <br><br>
              From reading what other people write, I have this idea of what I want my writing to look like, how I want people to feel when they read it, and what I envision success to be. Knowing that there are these goals out there for myself makes it that much more difficult to just do the thing. I want each thing I make to be at the standard I expect, but having such high expectations hinders me from making anything at all. 
              <br><br>
              I wouldn’t consider myself a perfectionist, but there’s that idea that procrastination is a form of perfectionism manifesting itself in a way that paralyzes people from taking action. You keep putting off what you want to do in fear that when you do it it won’t be good enough. There’s definitely truth in that - I experienced it all day today. 
              <br><br>
              So, how do we get over it?
              <br><br>
              My incredibly wise advice for myself and anyone out there (which is no one lol because I haven’t shared the link with anyone yet) is Nike’s three word slogan: <br><b>just do it</b>. 
              <br><br>
              It doesn’t matter if it’s bad, or not to the standard that you set. All that matters is that you had the courage to do what you wanted to do. Shifting our mindset of celebrating achievements to celebrating progress is a liberating thing. It validates your interest in something as reason enough to do it, regardless of your skill. We all know that even experts had to start somewhere, even if it’s hard to remember that. 
              <br><br>
              So instead of writing about what I thought I was going to write about today (instant gratification), I thought about why it was so difficult for me to write. And in the process of doing that, I finished writing a piece today. Two birds, one stone - pretty good if I do say so myself.
