              Today’s the day! I’ve been thinking about starting this project for almost a month now, but every time I tried to work on it I’d get pulled into something else more pressing — ie. school, job recruiting, interview prep, etc. I’m finally putting my foot down and carving out the time to do the things I want to do. 
              <br><br>
              In December last year, I wanted to start a blog. I thought I was going to get really into writing, I fleshed out exactly why I wanted to start and what I hoped to get out of it. I copied the piece over here because everything I wrote then is still relevant now. I still want to write to 1. improve my communication skills, 2. for personal growth, 3. to document experiences and thoughts, and 4. to connect with others. 
              <br><br>
              Not long after that though, school and other responsibilities got in the way (as they typically do), and I didn’t even think about writing until the pandemic happened and I suddenly found myself back at home with an infinite amount of spare time at my hands. 
              <br><br>
              Now, more than 6 weeks into the stay at home order, I figure there’s no better time to start doing the things I’ve been putting off. So that’s what this space is for. I’ve always felt that I’ve had an interest in creating things but I never really gave myself the time to actually explore. I want to use this site to collect and document the things that I make as I learn and work on writing, illustrating, lettering, animating, and whatever else I feel like doing. 
              <br><br>
              I decided to separate this from Medium because I want it to exist on its own and I feel like there’s so much content on Medium it’s easy to get distracted by what other people are doing and the number of views or claps and all that jazz. Although- I haven’t figured out how exactly I want to separate things because there might be some thoughts that I do want to share with other people so those might make it onto my Medium account, but we’ll see. 
              <br><br>
              I’ve had this nagging feeling that this is something I need to start, as cliche as it sounds. I’ve realized I think I want to start something on my own in the future, whatever that ends up to be. I find the idea of running a public blog really enticing, but I have to test out whether I actually enjoy writing and creating things as much as I think I do before taking that on.
              <br><br>
              Anyways, bottom line, the goal for this site is to keep me accountable for spending time on things that I actually want to spend my time on. So without further ado, welcome to my space on the internet where I explore, create, and document things. We’ll see how this goes  —
