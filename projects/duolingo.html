              Duolingo is a language-learning platform used by millions around the world. Known for its gamification and personalized learning content, Duolingo provides users a fun and accessible way to learn a new language. The language curriculum is broken down into bite-sized lessons and the platform offers rewards, competitions, and other forms of learning content (such as stories and podcasts) to keep users coming back.

              <b class="big-heading">Feature Idea Description</b>
              <br> 
              Duolingo Groups is a feature that would allow users to create groups of friends to compete with in weekly competitions. Similar to Leagues, this is a leaderboard-style competition that operates on a weekly basis. However, instead of being matched with 50 new, random users each week (which is how League competitions currently operate), these competitions would be between friends. Users within friend groups could compete for the highest XP each week, as well as most all-time wins and highest win streak.
             <br><br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Rationale</b>
              <br> 
              Language learning is inherently social, and there is an opportunity to better utilize the ability to add and view friends on Duolingo. This feature aims to engage users who are motivated by seeing progress of people they know. Especially under current circumstances, people are looking to maintain and strengthen their social connections through technology, and Duolingo could provide a fun and worthwhile way to do that.
             <br><br>

              <div class="med-heading">Impact on Selected KPI</div>
              <br>
              The daily active users (DAU) to monthly active users (MAU) ratio is an important KPI to evaluate because in this case it directly impacts both the value users gain from the platform as well as the platform’s success.<br><br>

              Defining the term “active” to mean the user completes at least one lesson on Duolingo in a given time period, increasing the DAU / MAU ratio would mean that on average, users are engaging in lessons more days out of the month than they were before.<br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Benefit to users:</b> by using the app daily, users are increasing their exposure to the language they’re learning, allowing themselves to regularly practice and develop their language skills. Additionally, users who are active daily are able to continue their streaks and earn more rewards on the platform. 
                </li><br>
                <li>
                  <b>Benefit to Duolingo:</b> having users engage more often with the app would increase the overall time spent on the platform (assuming the number of users stays consistent), which increases opportunity for ad revenue. This feature also facilitates referrals - having existing users bring in new users, who then start engaging frequently - which is reflected in an increase in the total number of daily and monthly active users.
                </li> 
              </ul>
              <br><br>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Functionality & User Stories</b><br>
              Outlining the basic functions for users to be able to participate in Groups:
              <ol>
              <li>As a user, I want to <b>add a friend</b>, so that I can be
              in a Group with them.</li>
              <li>As a user with friends added, I want to <b>create a
              Group</b>, so that I can compete with them.</li>
              <li>As a user in a Group, I want to <b>see my
              performance</b> relative to my friends, so that I can
              improve my performance accordingly.</li>
              </ol>

            </p>

            <br><br>
            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Prototypes</b><br>
              Following Duolingo's branding and current app layout, this feature is designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing app. [Note: the Duolingo app has updated since this project was completed, so some of the references to what was “current” may be out of date.]<br><br>

              <div class="med-heading">Adding a Friend</div><br>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">

              </div>
              <div class="med-heading">Creating a Group</div><br>
              <div class="row">

                </div>
              </div>
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Hypothesis Validation</b><br>
              The primary underlying assumption for this feature is that users want a social component to their experience with Duolingo, and they’re motivated by friendly competition with people they know more than competing with strangers.  <br><br>

              To validate this hypothesis before building out the feature completely: 
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Analyze performance of current and past features that incorporated some social aspect. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Even though the friends functionality is underutilized, looking at a user’s friends could potentially indicate whether there is a relationship between how active a user’s friends are and how active the user is themselves (i.e. if all of a user’s friends haven’t gained any XP in the last week, does that mean there is a higher chance that the user is also not active?)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Breaking down components of the discontinued Clubs feature would be helpful in determining whether the assumptions are valid. Understanding the reasons for removing this functionality could provide insight on whether users were engaging well with the social component.  
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Solicit feedback from current users on social media, Duolingo Forum, etc. 
                </li>

                <li>Build out part of it first — specifically, implement the change in the process to add a friend (from following to requesting a friend). 
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Track the results from this change first.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Check whether the average number of friends a user has changes significantly, an increase could indicate that people do want to have social connections on Duolingo.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The idea would be that incoming requests serve as reminders of the friend-requesting ability and people would be encouraged to add more people they know. 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

            </p>
            
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Metrics & Evaluation</b><br>

              Post-implementation, some metrics that should be tracked are:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>DAU and MAU to calculate the DAU / MAU ratio</li>
                <li>The change in average number of friends a user has</li>
                <li>The percentage of users who join a Group (are in at least one Group)</li>
                <li>The average number of Groups a user is in</li>
                <li>The average number of friends in any Group</li>
                <li>The average winning weekly XP value</li>
                <li>The percentage of Groups who have at least one member not complete any lessons in the given week</li>
              </ul>

              These metrics can be used in the following ways:<br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Comparing the DAU / MAU ratio before and after the Groups feature was implemented quantifies its impact in terms of average number of days per month users are engaging with the app</li>
                <li>Analyzing general use of Groups and tying it back to XP to see whether users in Groups are more motivated to complete lessons / activities</li> 
                <li>Looking at the frequency at which Groups go inactive or have inactive members to consider maintaining a minimum level of activity to continue competitions</li>
                <li>Running A/B tests to find the right guidelines for the feature
                  <ul>
                    <li>Potentially limiting the number of Groups a user can be a part of, and finding the optimal number it would be to balance engagement and fairness</li>
                    <li>Determining minimum and maximum number of users in one Group</li> 
                  </ul>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
              <b class="big-heading">Takeaways & Lessons</b><br>

              Groups has the potential to improve user engagement and increase the number of active users by utilizing people's social connections to draw them into the platform. A relatively feasible idea mostly using pre-existing functionality, this feature has a high value potential while requiring a low implementation effort.

              <br><br>
              Overall, this entire project process was an enjoyable and challenging learning experience. Duolingo's wild success stems from how good its product is, which made this task that much more difficult. From conducting in-depth research into the product to ideating on different solutions, I was able practice thinking through and designing a product idea from end to end. Taking into account the impact on business strategy, user experience design, engineering elements, and metric evaluation, I had a lot of fun exploring the different moving parts that building a new feature entails.
