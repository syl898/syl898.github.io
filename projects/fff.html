              At Carnegie Mellon, food fundraisers are a staple in the campus involvement ecosystem. Many student organizations will set up a table in a high-traffic area on campus to sell food to fundraise for their organization or another initiative they’re supporting. From Krispy Kreme to Chick-Fil-A, bake sales to bento boxes, different student groups sell a wide variety of different food items. For students passing by, these food fundraisers provide an alternative to traditional on-campus food establishments. <br><br>
              As students with experience hosting these fundraisers and knowing first-hand the challenges in spreading the word about them, our team decided to explore ideas that could facilitate this process. We also recognized that many students were tired of on-campus dining options, and we saw an opportunity at the intersection of these two groups.

              <b class="big-heading">Exploring the Food Fundraiser Experience</b>
              <br>
              We first conducted interviews with students around campus to understand people’s different experiences engaging with food fundraisers. A few key points from our research findings:
              <ul>
                <li>
                Organizations typically promote their fundraisers by creating Facebook events and having members invite their Facebook friends to the event. Members of the organization also sometimes take it upon themselves to contact their own friends and urge them to support the fundraiser.</li>
                <li>
                Most consumers buy food from fundraisers for three reasons: 1) if they are affiliated with the hosting organization, 2) are friends with someone affiliated, or 3) really like the food that’s being sold. </li>
                <li>
                Other factors that people consider when purchasing from a food fundraiser are what type of food is offered, how hungry they are, whether it’s a reasonable price (comparable to an on-campus food establishment), payment method, whether they have cash, and the quality of food. </li>
              </ul>

              <br><br><br><br>
              <div class="big-heading"> Creating User Personas</div><br>
              From our research, we identified three potential users of this platform: one from the organizer's perspective and two from different consumers. <br><br>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <img src="../img/proj-imgs/fff-1.png" draggable = "false" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
              </div>

              <br><br><br><br>
              <div class="big-heading"> Ideating</div><br>
              With these personas in mind, we ideated on different components of a platform that would satisfy their needs. Thinking about what pieces of information would be useful for fundraiser organizers to convey about their events as well as what functionality be most useful for users engaging with the platform, we brainstormed ideas for what that would look like.  <br><br>

              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
                <div class="col-lg-10">
                  <img src="../img/proj-imgs/fff-2.png" draggable = "false" class="img-fluid">

                <div class="col-sm-1"></div>
              </div><br><br>

              Deciding how to handle who creates fundraiser events on the platform was one of our largest challenges. The two ideas we considered were modeled after concepts from popular social media sites: 1) Facebook, where individual users are able to publish event pages or 2) Instagram, where organizations have separate accounts they post from. We ultimately decided to go with the second option because organizations frequently change leadership and membership so we felt that having a separate organization login would make transitioning access easier for students.<br><br>

              <br><br><br><br>
              <div class="big-heading">Sample Wireframes</div><br>

              For the scope of this project, we focused on the user flow of a student exploring and searching for a specific food fundraiser. Through user testing, we refined our low-fi wireframes according to user feedback. Some design choices we made included organizing events based on location first for our Convenience Motivated Consumers and making the search page filters so Friend Motivated Consumers can easily search for fundraisers by organizations their friends are in.

              <div class="big-heading">Takeaways</div><br>
              This project allowed us to think about the food fundraiser experience with new lenses, considering both the organizer and consumer sides. One of my first experiences working in Figma, this project provided an opportunity to learn by doing. We faced challenges working through the transition into remote learning due to COVID-19, but adapted to the best of our ability to finish the project.
